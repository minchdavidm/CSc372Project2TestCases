# CSc372Project2TestCases
This repository contains test cases for Project 2 in CSc372 Fall 2019 University of Arizona.

These test cases currently are for parts 1-6 only. If I have time to get to making test cases for 7 I will, or if someone wants to make a pull request with problem 7 test cases, feel free to.

Since this is a haskell program calling other haskell programs, it needs the other programs to be written with modules. For that, a makefile included will duplicate all of your programs and add a "module Filename where" line to the start. I suggest backing up your code first though in case something goes weird, after all, this is my first time using Haskell.

These test cases currently only display the received and expected output, so you have to check the differences yourself. Likewise, if someone wants to submit a pull request that makes it compare the strings instead of just showing them, feel free to.
