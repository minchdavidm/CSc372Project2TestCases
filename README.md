# CSc372Project2TestCases
This repository contains test cases for Project 2 in CSc372 Fall 2019 University of Arizona.

Since this is a haskell program calling other haskell programs, it needs the other programs to be written with modules. For that, a makefile included will duplicate all of your programs and add a "module Filename where" line to the start. I suggest backing up your code first though in case something goes weird, after all, this is my first time using Haskell.

The test cases will display the expected output if there are any differences. If you find any errors, please let me know on Piazza.
